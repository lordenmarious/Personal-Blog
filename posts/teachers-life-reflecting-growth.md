*Day 3: Finding Meaning in the Small Moments*

Day 3 started off a bit differently than the others. Maybe it’s because by this point in the week, I’ve settled into a rhythm. Or maybe it’s because I’ve had enough time to reflect on the past couple of days and learn from them. But either way, I felt more centered and ready to take on the challenges that awaited me.

The students seemed more engaged today. I don’t know if it was because of the momentum from the previous two days or if they’d just warmed up to the material, but the energy was palpable. In class, we dove deep into a topic that usually stirs some debate. Today, though, the discussion felt different. There was more nuance in their arguments, a deeper level of thinking that hadn’t been there before. It was as if the students were beginning to see the connections between their own lives and the concepts I was teaching. There’s nothing more rewarding than seeing that moment of understanding light up in a student’s eyes.

It wasn’t just the students who had grown over the past few days. I found myself reflecting on how I’ve evolved as a teacher. In my early years, I would’ve been flustered by a student’s outburst or a fire drill disrupting my class. Now, I take a deep breath, assess the situation, and move forward. I’ve learned that teaching isn’t just about having all the answers — it’s about learning and growing alongside your students. There’s something humbling about that.

After class, I had some time to catch up on grading. It’s always a bit of a grind, but there’s a sense of satisfaction in seeing the progress students have made. I find myself looking at their work not just to assign grades, but to identify patterns and trends in their learning. Where are they excelling? Where do they need more help? What can I do differently to engage them even more? These are questions I ask myself regularly.

I also had a small moment of appreciation from a student who stayed after class to thank me for a lesson. It was a simple gesture, but it reminded me of why I do this work. It’s not about accolades or recognition — it’s about knowing that you’ve made a difference in someone’s life, even in small ways.

As I head into the weekend, I realize that teaching isn’t just a job. It’s a calling. Each day presents its own challenges, but it also offers new opportunities to connect, grow, and make a meaningful impact. Reflecting on these three days, I can see how much I’ve learned and how much more I still have to learn. And that’s what keeps me going — the understanding that teaching is a journey of constant growth, both for myself and for my students.
